## Project Ideas
list of project ideas

* The [Open Elections Data repo for Ohio](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh) is ripe for some visualizations. Are there any interesting mashups with other data sets that should exist? Perhaps something with [Census Data](http://www.census.gov/developers/)?
* Interested in elections data, but tired of Ohio? Why not pick a different state and help out the [OpenElections](http://www.openelections.net/) with scraping or data processing?
* There has been talk over the years of setting up an Open Data Portal for Code For Dayton. Now is the time to do something about it. Could you investigate or standup a [CKAN](https://ckan.org/)/[DKAN](http://getdkan.com/)/Other Open Data Portal that we could start utilizing brigade (or city)-wide?
* Code For Dayton does not have an official Open Data Policy separate from the [Code For America](http://archive.codeforamerica.org/practices/open/open-data/) stance. Should we?
* Put together a response to [House Bill 482](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text) (analysis [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13607781)). This could be fun data-activism task that focuses more on policy than code.
