# Open Data Day 2017
Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data in Dayton and all over
the world. We will be using open data to build applications and visualizations
to show the benefits of open data, as well as encouraging the adoption of open
data policies in local government, businesses, and civil society.

Please RSVP for the event on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Dayton/events/237417370/).

## It's a Slackathon <i class="fa fa-slack"></i>!
For this event, instead of meeting at a physical location, weâ€™ll be
coordinating via the #opendataday channel on the OpenDayton Slack team. To
join, visit http://opendayton.org and click the <i class="fa fa-slack"></i> Slack button.

## Project Ideas
list of project ideas

* The [Open Elections Data repo for Ohio](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh) is ripe for some visualizations. Are there any interesting mashups with other data sets that should exist? Perhaps something with [Census Data](http://www.census.gov/developers/)?
* Interested in elections data, but tired of Ohio? Why not pick a different state and help out the [OpenElections](http://www.openelections.net/) with scraping or data processing?
* There has been talk over the years of setting up an Open Data Portal for Code For Dayton. Now is the time to do something about it. Could you investigate or standup a [CKAN](https://ckan.org/)/[DKAN](http://getdkan.com/)/Other Open Data Portal that we could start utilizing brigade (or city)-wide?
* Code For Dayton does not have an official Open Data Policy separate from the [Code For America](http://archive.codeforamerica.org/practices/open/open-data/) stance. Should we?
* Put together a response to [House Bill 482](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text) (analysis [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13607781)). This could be fun data-activism task that focuses more on policy than code.
