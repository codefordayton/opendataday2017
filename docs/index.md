# <svg class="odd-h1"><use xlink:href="#odd-nostyle" /></svg>Open Data Day 2017
Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data in Dayton and all over
the world. We will be using open data to build applications and visualizations
to show the benefits of open data, as well as encouraging the adoption of open
data policies in local government, businesses, and civil society.

Please RSVP for the event on <i class="fa fa-meetup"></i>[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Dayton/events/237417370/).

## It's a Slackathon <i class="fa fa-slack"></i>!
For this event, instead of meeting at a physical location, weâ€™ll be
coordinating via the #opendataday channel on the OpenDayton Slack team. To
join, visit [http://opendayton.org](http://opendayton.org) and click the <i class="fa fa-slack"></i> Slack button.

## Project Ideas
<span class="ideas">
    <span class="idea">
        <span class="idea__title">Ohio Election Data Visualizations</span>
        Voter turnout is a
        [problem in the United States](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/).
        Why is that? Are certain Ohio counties or precincts above or below the national average?
        Do we have problems with voter-to-precinct ratios that make it more problematic for certain
        communities to vote? Do all Ohio voters have easy access to polling locations? Make a quick
        visualization or an in depth application exploring these issues.

        <span class="idea__title">Code for Dayton Open Data Portal</span>
        There has been talk over the years of setting up an Open Data Portal for Code For Dayton. Now is the time to do something about it. Could you investigate or standup a [CKAN](https://ckan.org/)/[DKAN](http://getdkan.com/)/Other Open Data Portal that we could start utilizing brigade (or city)-wide?
    </span>
    <span class="idea">
        <span class="idea__title">Open Data Policy</span>
        Code For Dayton does not have an official Open Data Policy separate from the [Code For America](http://archive.codeforamerica.org/practices/open/open-data/) stance. Should we?
        As part of this, we could put together a response to [House Bill 482](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text) (analysis [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13607781)). This could be fun data-activism task that focuses more on policy than code.
    </span>

        <span class="idea__title">(Your Great Idea Here)</span>
        Is there an application or visualization based on open data that you wish existed? Want some help with it? Post your
        idea to our slack channel during the event and get some help turning it into a reality!
